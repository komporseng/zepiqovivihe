Apart from YouTube, CeyNoLimit has a lot of fan followers on his various social media platforms.</p><p>He is famous on <strong>Instagram</strong> with more than 251K followers. Similarly, he is also active on Twitter with more than 9K followers.</p><p>Moreover, he is available on Snapchat under the username ‘@Cee_y’. Cey has also shared his Gmail, <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=66150e071108260d120b070807010314154805090b>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>, for business inquiries.</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Stardom>Rise to Stardom</span></h2><p>During his college days, CeyNoLimit decided to begin a YouTube channel where he could further talk about his interest in the sport and post reactions about NBA matches.</p><p>His YouTube is a complete package of entertainment. He blends pranks, challenges, and stories to make his videos very fun and engaging to watch.</p><p>He has earned a lot of attention in a very short period and some of the credit goes to his cool, funny, and frank personality.</p><p>Ever since Cey was a kid, he was always keen and passionate about basketball. But, he later switched his career path to the entertainment and YouTube industry.</p><p>As a result, he gained a lot of popularity on his channel. He joined his YouTube channel ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CeyNoLimit</a>‘ on October 23, 2014.</p><p>However, he flagged off his vlogging journey only in April 2018 with the video ‘NBA YOUNGBOY – My Happiness Took Away For Life | Audio REACTION’ (no longer available).</p><p>This set the tone for his channel in its initial days, and he started similarly posting more videos. In no time, he got the hang of social media and started posting consistently.</p><p>His sense of humor and passion helped him find his feet and many people started subscribing to his channel.</p><p>After his fanbase widened, Cey decided to explore more topics of interest to millennials, his target demographic.</p><p>He realized the dearth of humorous content when it came to dating and started focusing on the tricky subject funnily.</p><p>Moreover, it also helped him collaborate with several other social media celebrities who would join him in his practical pranks to share tips with his viewers.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-47092 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CeyNoLimit-video.jpg alt=CeyNoLimit width=650 height=364 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-47092 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: CeyNo while making a YouTube video.
