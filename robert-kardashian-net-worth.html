He was a famous businessman and attorney, who came to real prominence when working as an attorney during the 1995 murder trial of <a href=#>Orenthal James (OJ – ‘Juice’) Simpson</a>. What is more, Robert was known for being the father of <a href=#>Kourtney</a>, <a href=#>Rob</a>, <a href=#>Kim</a> and <a href=#>Khloe Kardashians</a>, who are now very popular. Unfortunately, Robert died of cancer when he was only 59 years old. There is no doubt that if Robert would have lived longer he would have achieved even more in his career as an attorney and would be happy to see his children creating families and fame of their own.</p><p>So how rich was Robert Kardashian? It is authoritively estimated that Robert’s net worth was $30 million. The main source of this sum of money was, of course, from his work as an attorney. In addition to this, Robert’s other activities also added to this sum of money. Although his net worth will not become higher, he is remembered for his work and achievements.</p><h3>Robert Kardashian Net Worth $30 Million</h3><p>Robert’s parents were involved in the meat-packing business and were one of the most famous businesspeople in the area. There is no surprise that Robert was also somehow involved in all these activities and saw how business works from up close, and quite possibly this influenced his choice of studying business administration at the University of Southern California. Later he continued his studies at the University of San Diego School of Law, where he gained a law degree. In 1973 Robert created the company called “Radio & Records”, which had a huge impact on the growth of Robert’s net worth. Despite the success of the company, Robert and his partners decided to sell it.</p><p>In 1995 Robert became very famous as he participated in the case of <a href=#>O.J. Simpson</a> when he was accused of killing Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. In the end the charges against him were dropped. This case not only made Robert famous as an attorney but also had an impact on his net worth. Unfortunately, Robert was not able to make himself even more acclaimed and famous as he suffered from a serious illness and in 2003 died as a result of esophageal cancer. Sadly, this determined and hardworking person had to leave his family and everything he had achieved behind.</p><p>To talk about Robert’s personal life, he was married three times. His first marriage was with <a href=#>Kris Houghton</a> in 1978; they divorced in 1991 and from this marriage Robert had four children. In 1998 Robert married Jan Ashley, but their marriage did not last long and they divorce one year later. In 2003 Robert married for the third time, but he was not able to enjoy this marriage for long as he died in the same year. Finally, Robert Kardashian was a successful businessperson and determined attorney. Unfortunately, he was not able to enjoy his successful life for as long as he probably wanted as he died when he was 59 years old. He was also not able to see his children growing and becoming celebrities. Let’s hope that his name and his work will still be remembered.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=14.237288135593><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Robert Kardashian</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$30 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 22, 1944</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>September 30, 2003, Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.7&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Lawyer, Businessperson</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>USC Marshall School of Business</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Spouse</td><td>Ellen Pierson, Jan Ashley, Kris Jenner</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Rob Kardashian</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Arthur Kardashian, Helen Kardashian</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Tom Kardashian, Barbara Kardashian</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Blac Chyna</td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm1507976</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>Khloé & Lamar, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Rob & Chyna, Dancing with the Stars</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Thanks <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=thanks readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Series in memory of - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>A Token for Your Thoughts</td><td>2003</td><td>Short special thanks</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Absolutely 100% Guilty</td><td>1999</td><td>Video documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Trial of O.J.
