You are incarcerated for 2 months with real criminals, prison food, and obviously, you’re life’s at stake too! No wonder, fans predicated Jake Rust, the youngest participant with the least motivation, would only “last a day” in the cell.</span></p><p><span>But Jake was more than determined to change lives in the cell. So, while he does that, let’s get to know him better as this Jake Rust Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Jake Rust On 60 Days In</b></h3><p><span>A&E Network’s </span><i><span>60 Days In</span></i><span> is back for another season with seven brave participants who will be entering jail undercover to investigate the daily proceedings as part of a mission to evoke change. These good samaritans including Jake are ready to endanger their lives even if it means saving at least one soul in the prison.</span></p><p><span>But while some participants are former prisoners, drug addicts, or corrections officers, Jake’s only motivation to be on the show was his father, who was incarcerated when he was in high school. Another inspiration for Jake’s participation was the season 7’s participant Darius (his icon) who advised inmates how to improve themselves after release.</span></p><p><span>“I want to help inmates where they don’t make the same mistakes that might have got them there,” Jake said.</span></p><p><span>Now, Jake may look like a fanboy but his will to reform lives was second to none. And even if he may not last long, his courage to enter prison under a false identity for the sake of reform and entertainment is truly commendable.</span></p><p><span>Joining Jake as undercover prisoners for </span><i><span>60 days In</span></i><span> season 8 were his co-stars — Feli Flame, Curtis Williams, Sarah Anselment, Jamil Powell, Brittney, Clydell, Steven, and Charlotte.</span></p><h3><b>Jake Rust Age</b></h3><p><span>Jake Rust was 28 years of age when he appeared on “</span><i><span>60 Days In</span></i><span>” in 2023.</span></p><p><span>He was the youngest cast that season.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>Jake’s full name is Jacob M Rust.</span></p><h3><b>Jake Rust Family</b></h3><p><span>Although they didn’t have the best past, Jake Rust doesn’t mind sharing about his family, The </span><i><span>60 Days In</span></i><span> star said that his father John Rust was sent to prison when he was still in high school.
