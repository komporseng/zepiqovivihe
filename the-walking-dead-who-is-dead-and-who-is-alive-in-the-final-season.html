The show has killed off many beloved characters along the way, leaving fans wondering who will survive the end of the world. In this article, we will recap who is dead and who is alive in the final season of The Walking Dead, and what their fates might be.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Dead</h2><p>The Walking Dead has never shied away from killing off major characters, often in brutal and shocking ways. Some of the most memorable deaths in the show include:</p><ul><li><strong>Rick Grimes</strong> (Andrew Lincoln): The protagonist of the show for the first nine seasons, Rick was presumed dead after he blew up a bridge to stop a horde of walkers from reaching his friends. However, it was later revealed that he was rescued by a mysterious helicopter and taken away to an unknown location. His fate remains a mystery, but he is expected to return in a spin-off movie trilogy.</li><li><strong>Carl Grimes</strong> (Chandler Riggs): Rick’s son and one of the original survivors, Carl was bitten by a walker while saving a stranger named Siddiq. He died peacefully in his father’s arms, after writing letters to his loved ones and urging them to find a way to live together in peace.</li><li><strong>Glenn Rhee</strong> (Steven Yeun): A former pizza delivery boy and Maggie’s husband, Glenn was one of the most loyal and optimistic members of the group. He met his end at the hands of Negan, the ruthless leader of the Saviors, who bashed his head in with a baseball bat named Lucille.</li><li><strong>Abraham Ford</strong> (Michael Cudlitz): A former army sergeant and Rosita’s lover, Abraham was also killed by Negan in the same brutal scene as Glenn. He died defiantly, telling Negan to “suck my nuts”.</li><li><strong>Beth Greene</strong> (Emily Kinney): Maggie’s younger sister and a sweet and innocent girl, Beth was shot in the head by Dawn, the leader of a group of corrupt cops at a hospital in Atlanta. She died in Daryl’s arms, who had grown close to her during their time together.</li><li><strong>Hershel Greene</strong> (Scott Wilson): Maggie and Beth’s father and a former veterinarian, Hershel was a wise and compassionate man who acted as a moral compass for the group. He was decapitated by the Governor, the tyrannical leader of Woodbury, during an assault on the prison where the group was staying.</li><li><strong>Lori Grimes</strong> (Sarah Wayne Callies): Rick’s wife and Carl’s mother, Lori died during childbirth, giving birth to Judith.

She said goodbye to Carl, who then shot her in the head to prevent her from turning into a walker.</li><li><strong>Andrea</strong> (Laurie Holden): A former civil rights lawyer and one of the original survivors, Andrea was a strong and independent woman who often clashed with Rick. She was bitten by Milton, a scientist who worked for the Governor, and chose to kill herself before turning.

He then reanimated as a walker and was shot by Carl.</li><li><strong>Dale Horvath</strong> (Jeffrey DeMunn): An elderly man and a former salesman, Dale was the owner of the RV that the group used as their home in the first two seasons.
