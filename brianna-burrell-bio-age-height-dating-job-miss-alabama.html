She was last seen talking with one of her mentors, Kalyn Chapman, who was the first Black Miss Alabama and is also from Mobile.</span></p><p><span>“Now I’m here with the crown on my head, texting her, ‘Look, I did it, I did it,” Brianna said. “Not just for her, not just for me, but for the next Black Miss Alabama, for the next contestants who are going to follow me because they saw themselves in my work.”</span></p><p><span>Overwhelmed with the feat, she added,&nbsp; “It’s been a whirlwind of emotions and I’m still on an adrenaline rush, but it’s a confirmation and just an amazing sense of accomplishment.”</span></p><p><span>The Miss Alabama 2023 will spend the next year serving Alabama at public appearances, motivating others, furthering her community service initiative, and finally representing Alabama at the Miss America competition</span></p><p><span>To prepare for Miss America, Brianna said she will continue to work on her vocal prowess, which is her favorite part of the competition, and also draft a wardrobe that displays who she is.</span></p><h3><b>Brianna Burrell Age</b></h3><p><span>Brianna Burrell was 25 years of age when she won Miss Alabama 2023.</span></p><p><span>She is the oldest contestant to be crowned Miss Alabama in Miss Alabama history.</span></p><h3><b>Brianna Burrell Family</b></h3><p><span>Brianna Burrell comes from a family of five.</span></p><p><span>Her father, <a href=#>Cedric Burrell Sr</a>. joined Military Sealift Command and sailed the oceans until 1991.

I saw myself in this platform,” Brianna said. “I saw myself in this community service initiative. Back in 6th grade when I was the only black girl in the science club where time and time again, I had to fight for my voice to be heard, my intelligence not to be undermined and my work to be credited. And just my presence was an advocacy of itself.”</span></p><p><span>The initiative has three goals: funding, representation, and curriculum development.</span></p><p><span>According to Brianna, already over $3,000 has been raised just for Baldwin County and they are looking to expand across the state.</span></p><p><span>Besides this, Brianna is also an author who penned the children’s book In</span><i><span>vestigation Nation</span></i><span>, on diversity and working together to highlight contributions and inventors of color. “This book takes a look into the diverse world of inventors and inventions for students to explore,” she wrote.</span></p><p><span>You can buy her book on Amazon for $15.</span></p><h3><b>Brianna Burrell Height</b></h3><p><span>Brianna Burrell stands tall at a height of above 5 feet 8 inches (173 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning her distinct features, Brianna has brown eyes and hair and a fit body.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Brianna Burrell Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Brianna receives her birthday wishes on January 27 and is of the Aquarius zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Brianna Burrell On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>beingbriburrell</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s her Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>bri.b.burrell</span></a><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Brianna Burrell From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Brianna hails from Mobile, Alabama.</span></p><p><span>But in 2023, she resided in Saraland, Alabama.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmm6qZlruvrYybrKuqlaG5bq7IqGSan5Vitaa1xqGrZpyRqbavs4yjpptlnZ7AtHnApZibmZ2WfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrianna-burrell-bio-age-height-dating-job-miss-alabama.html&text=Who%20Is%20Brianna%20Burrell%3f%20Her%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Dating%2c%20Miss%20Alabama&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrianna-burrell-bio-age-height-dating-job-miss-alabama.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrianna-burrell-bio-age-height-dating-job-miss-alabama.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brianna%20Burrell%3f%20Her%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Dating%2c%20Miss%20Alabama" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrianna-burrell-bio-age-height-dating-job-miss-alabama.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brianna%20Burrell%3f%20Her%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Dating%2c%20Miss%20Alabama" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrianna-burrell-bio-age-height-dating-job-miss-alabama.html&title=Who%20Is%20Brianna%20Burrell%3f%20Her%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Dating%2c%20Miss%20Alabama" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrianna-burrell-bio-age-height-dating-job-miss-alabama.html&description=Who%20Is%20Brianna%20Burrell%3f%20Her%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Dating%2c%20Miss%20Alabama" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-playing-in-the-championship-college-football-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is playing in the Championship college football 2023?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mike-schank-passed-away-at-the-age-of-56.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mike Schank Passed Away At The Age Of 56">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
