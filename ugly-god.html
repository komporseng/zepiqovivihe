He was born to an Afro-Dominican father and an African-American mother. On his upbringing, Rodriguez said, “My mom and dad divorced, so I was raised in the South as a Black person. If you’ve been to the Dominican Republic, you should know they have a lot of Spanish, dark Dominicans. They are Black as fuck just like me. My dad happened to be a Black Dominican and my mom’s Black. African-Americans and Latinos have it rough in the U.S.—I’m both, so I guess I’m double rough”.</p><p>Rodriguez grew up speaking both Spanish and English. After a few months after his birth, the parents moved from Indiana to Cleveland, Ohio. They again moved to Ohio and then to Houston after two years of being in Ohio.
