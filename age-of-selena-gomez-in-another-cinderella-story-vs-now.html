Read More to know about How Old Was Selena Gomez in Another Cinderella Story?</p><h2>Who is Selena Gomez?</h2><p>Selena Marie Gomez is a singer from the United States. Gomez’s first job as an actress was on the kids’ show Barney & Friends. Selena Marie Gomez was born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas. Her parents were <strong>Ricardo Joel Gomez</strong> and <strong>Mandy Teefey</strong>, who was also from Texas but used to act on stage.</p><p>She was named for Selena Quintanilla, a Tejano singer who died in 1995. Her father’s family is from Mexico, and her mother, who was adopted, is from Italy. In the 1970s, Gomez’s grandfather’s family moved from Monterrey to Texas.

Barney taught me everything I know.” Between 2002 and 2004, Gomez was in thirteen episodes of the show. The producers let her go because they thought she was “too old” for the show.</p><p>Gomez had small parts in the movies <strong>Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over and Walker</strong>, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire while he was working on Barney & Friends.

Even though the premise of the original “<strong>A Cinderella Story</strong>” was based on a centuries-old cliche, the writing and performance nonetheless seemed contemporary.</p><p>Unfortunately, “Another Cinderella Story” was unable to achieve the same success. The narrative of “<strong>A Cinderella Story</strong>” follows two regular high school seniors as they completed college applications and engaged in normal senior-year activities.</p><p>The protagonists of “Another Cinderella Story” were a skilled but stage-shy high school dancer and a famous pop singer who opted to finish high school as a “regular child.”</p><h2>The Age Gap in Another Cinderella Story!</h2><p>The big difference in age between the main actors seemed to be the most controversial thing about “Another Cinderella Story.” When the movie was being made, Selena was only 15 years old, while Drew Seeley was 26.</p><p>One film critic said, “It’s too bad that their age isn’t taken into account more.” Hollywood is known for pairing older men with younger women in romantic roles, but Selena wasn’t even old enough to drive a car. Many people thought the difference in ages was too big.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cK3GnmSonl2osq2xzZpkoKedmsdutc1mmKenpJ2ys3nCoqWdnaKaua2tjKyrqKqpYsO0ec2ormg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fage-of-selena-gomez-in-another-cinderella-story-vs-now.html&text=Age%20of%20Selena%20Gomez%20in%20Another%20Cinderella%20Story%20vs%20Now%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fage-of-selena-gomez-in-another-cinderella-story-vs-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fage-of-selena-gomez-in-another-cinderella-story-vs-now.html&title=Age%20of%20Selena%20Gomez%20in%20Another%20Cinderella%20Story%20vs%20Now%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fage-of-selena-gomez-in-another-cinderella-story-vs-now.html&title=Age%20of%20Selena%20Gomez%20in%20Another%20Cinderella%20Story%20vs%20Now%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fage-of-selena-gomez-in-another-cinderella-story-vs-now.html&title=Age%20of%20Selena%20Gomez%20in%20Another%20Cinderella%20Story%20vs%20Now%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fage-of-selena-gomez-in-another-cinderella-story-vs-now.html&description=Age%20of%20Selena%20Gomez%20in%20Another%20Cinderella%20Story%20vs%20Now%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./director-of-upmc-tracy-showman-obituary-death-cause.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Director Of UPMC: Tracy Showman Obituary And Death Cause">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michael-phelps.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Phelps - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
