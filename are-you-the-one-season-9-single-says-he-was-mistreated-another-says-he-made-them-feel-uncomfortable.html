In a series of tweets posted on February 15, the contestant claimed the producers are&nbsp;“saving the cast”&nbsp;by not airing horrible events he insists occurred.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>After reviewing this latest episode of <a href=#>#ayto</a> and it’s copycat on Netflix <a href=#>#perfectmatch</a>…I’m really disappointed that I’m more engaged with a spin-off show I’m NOT on</p><p>HOW!?!?</p><p>Why are the producers saving the cast<br>I witnessed so much ugly during the filming of AYTO<a href=#>#ayto9</a> <a href=#>#aytos9</a></p><p>— Eduardo Dickson Jr (@EduardoMrNy) <a href=#>February 15, 2023</a></p></figure><p>For example, the entrepreneur&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said he was “mistreated”</a>&nbsp;and accused some of his “insecure and spineless” co-stars of teaming up on him, purposefully pushing his buttons, and trying to “jump” him.</p><p>According to Eduardo, he didn’t react out of fear of receiving the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“angry Black man” label.</a>&nbsp;Additionally, the reality TV star refused to name the culprits due to his contract preventing him. However, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">promised to name three people</a>&nbsp;he intended to call out to a boxing match.</p><h2><strong>Taylor Kelly said Eduardo made her feel uncomfortable</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Castmate Taylor Kelly</a> responded to Eduardo’s claims in a now-deleted tweet&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">uploaded to Reddit.</a>&nbsp;She accused him of tripping people, stealing clothes, and making her feel uncomfortable when she changed, resulting in producers asking him to leave the room.</p><p>Additionally, Taylor said she frequently made his way into conversations when he saw cameras. Eduardo quickly responded, referring to her as&nbsp;“Spongebob Square Chest,”&nbsp;and denied her accusations.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>SPONGEBOB SQUARE CHEST you listen here.

BTW if I’m somewhere before you and you tell me to leave ..</p><p>— Eduardo Dickson Jr (@EduardoMrNy) <a href=#>February 15, 2023</a></p></figure><p>He also claimed that no one wanted to watch her change, leading Taylor to ask him why producers had to ask him to leave the room multiple times. Eduardo seemed to confirm this in his reply, noting, “btw if I’m somewhere before you and you tell me to leave..”</p><p>She called him out for insulting her looks and pointed out that he told her she had the best picture shortly after filming. After a back-and-forth exchange about his “lil screen time,” Taylor brought up Eduardo apparently lying about his emergency contact information and said he tried to provoke fights in the house.</p><h2><strong>Eduardo also accused a castmate of stealing his charger</strong></h2><p>He didn’t respond to the allegation but&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">continued to tweet</a>&nbsp;about his castmates, accusing someone of stealing a charger from his house. No one else seemed to engage with Eduardo and his tweets, but Jordanne replied to his latest post with laughing emojis.</p><p>The following day, Taylor asked her castmate if he wanted to&nbsp;“start unnecessary Twitter beef”&nbsp;again, but Eduardo declined because she “deletes her tweets,” making it pointless.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>ADHD is adhding again today, wondering if <a href=#>@EduardoMrNy</a> would like to speak his mind and start unnecessary twitter beef today? <a href=#>#ayto</a></p><p>— Taylor Kelly (@taylork_13) <a href=#>February 16, 2023</a></p></figure><p>Although Eduardo hasn’t had much camera time, it’s clear he has connected with Jordanne the most. However, their relationship hasn’t received much screen time, and they’re probably not a perfect match due to the number of times they’ve sat together without receiving more beams.</p><p>Taylor <a href=#>connected with Will Gagnon,</a> and they thought they would enter the Honeymoon Suite first until the Truth Booth confirmed they weren’t a perfect match. She has since sat with Sam Khan in back-to-back ceremonies, but their connection hasn’t received any screen time.&nbsp;Are You the One?&nbsp;Season 9 airs Wednesdays on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOmqmeZamkwm7Ax55kqKaVYsCmrdKopWZxXai2r7PLnmSsmamoeqmxjLCYrGWdnsC1vsSaq56cXZa7sMDHnqlmq5GuwG60xGakmpyVYsGpscxmnZ6dnGLCr6%2FOpp2oqqSWr62xjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-you-the-one-season-9-single-says-he-was-mistreated-another-says-he-made-them-feel-uncomfortable.html&text=%27Are%20You%20the%20One%3f%27%20Season%209%20Single%20Says%20He%20Was%20%27Mistreated%3b%27%20Another%20Says%20He%20Made%20Them%20Feel%20Uncomfor&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-you-the-one-season-9-single-says-he-was-mistreated-another-says-he-made-them-feel-uncomfortable.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-you-the-one-season-9-single-says-he-was-mistreated-another-says-he-made-them-feel-uncomfortable.html&title=%27Are%20You%20the%20One%3f%27%20Season%209%20Single%20Says%20He%20Was%20%27Mistreated%3b%27%20Another%20Says%20He%20Made%20Them%20Feel%20Uncomfor" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-you-the-one-season-9-single-says-he-was-mistreated-another-says-he-made-them-feel-uncomfortable.html&title=%27Are%20You%20the%20One%3f%27%20Season%209%20Single%20Says%20He%20Was%20%27Mistreated%3b%27%20Another%20Says%20He%20Made%20Them%20Feel%20Uncomfor" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-you-the-one-season-9-single-says-he-was-mistreated-another-says-he-made-them-feel-uncomfortable.html&title=%27Are%20You%20the%20One%3f%27%20Season%209%20Single%20Says%20He%20Was%20%27Mistreated%3b%27%20Another%20Says%20He%20Made%20Them%20Feel%20Uncomfor" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-you-the-one-season-9-single-says-he-was-mistreated-another-says-he-made-them-feel-uncomfortable.html&description=%27Are%20You%20the%20One%3f%27%20Season%209%20Single%20Says%20He%20Was%20%27Mistreated%3b%27%20Another%20Says%20He%20Made%20Them%20Feel%20Uncomfor" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eva-hrdinov.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eva Hrdinov">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-vampire-diaries-producer-julie-plec-racist-controversy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Vampire Diaries Producer Julie Plec Racist Controversy?
