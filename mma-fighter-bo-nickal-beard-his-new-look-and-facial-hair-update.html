They are so intrigued and startled by his most recent change in appearance.</strong></p><p>Bo Nickal is a professional MMA fighter from the United States who fights in the NCAA boxing middleweight class.</p><p>One of the most promising prospects in the history of the sport is the 26-year-old native of Colorado.</p><p>On September 27, Bo Nickal (2-0-0) and Donovan Beard (7-1-0) will engage in a heart-pounding battle.</p><h2><span id=Updated_appearance_and_facial_hair_for_Bo_Nickal_Beard>Updated appearance and facial hair for Bo Nickal Beard</span></h2><p>In a recent photo, Bo Nickal can be seen sporting short hair and a beard. He decided to have a buzz cut, which completely changes the way he looks.</p><p>When a photo of Bo with UFC President Dana White appeared online, he had a new appearance.</p><p>Fans are shocked to witness such significant changes in his looks.</p><p>Bo will take part in Dana White’s Contender Series season 6 finale as one of the competitors. ESPN+ will broadcast the Week 10 episode on September 27, 2022.</p><p>It will feature five fights, including the middleweight contest between Bo Nickal and Donovan Beard.</p><p>In essence, Dana White uses the Contender Series as a scouting tool to find athletes that would be a good match for the UFC.</p><h2><span id=Bo_Nickal8217s_Evolution_Of_Style>Bo Nickal’s Evolution Of Style</span></h2><p>Bo Nickal has pleasantly surprised everyone before with a fresh appearance. The senior wrestler for Penn State has no problem experimenting. He seeks out contests inside and outside the ring.</p><p>Throughout his career, Bo has donned a variety of beards and hairstyles, including long bleached blond hair, a crew cut, and a thick ginger beard.</p><p>His distinctive red beard and short blonde hair serve as his go-to looks.</p><p>Bo shocked viewers at the start of the 2018 season by going full Saiyan and dying his hair blue. Some people stated that he looked more like Goku from Dragon Ball Z, while Mark Hall said he resembled the well-known Fortnite streamer Ninja.</p><p>Once the season started, however, the blue hue rapidly turned to his regular blond.</p><p>Bo originally had blonde hair that she colored red in high school and has now gone back to blonde.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_Nickal_Bo_Is_Rich_And_Young>Net Worth: Nickal Bo Is Rich And Young</span></h2><p>Bo Nickal reportedly has a net worth of $5 million, according to BJJ Fanatics. Given that he is just 26 years old, the amount is remarkable.</p><p>Bo still has a long way to go to leave a greater legacy and acquire more cash since the typical professional boxer quits at the age of 37.</p><p>The MMA fighter moved to Wyoming when he was around five years old after being born in Rifle, Colorado, in the US. In Wyoming, he first took up wrestling.</p><p>Bo won the U23 World Championship and the US Open National Championship in freestyle wrestling in 2019.</p><p>He won three Big Ten Conference championships and three NCAA Division I National Championships while wrestling at Penn State University.</p><p>He also received the 2019 Dan Hodge Trophy, the 2019 Big Ten Athlete of the Year honor, and two Schalles Awards.</p><p>The 6-foot-1, 185-pound middleweight fighter has a 2-0-0 pro-MMA record. Bo has therefore won both of his two contests. He has a four-game winning streak.</p><p>Bo overcame Zachary Borrego earlier this season, but the major match will now pit him against the more seasoned Donovan Beard. If Bo prevails, he will fight again on a UFC show.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Viggo Sorensen, Avivasofia, and Giselle Guilmette."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":37}{"1":43,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":60}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/viggo-sorensen/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/avivasofia/"}{"1":37}{"1":43,"2":"https://popularbio.com/giselle-guilmette/"}{"1":60}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Viggo Sorensen</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Avivasofia</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Giselle Guilmette</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>MMA Fighter</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Justyn Vicky Religion | Was He Christian Or Jewish | Ethnicity And Origin</a></h3>Justyn Vicky was an Indonesian bodybuilder, personal trainer, and fitness influencer who was 33 years old.
