While he occasionally drives his kids to public activities, he likes spending time in private with his family. Kevin Hart has been enjoying his time with his developing kid Hendrix Hart for the past few years.</p><p>Due to the numerous pictures that Kevin has posted of him on social media, his son Hendrix now has a fan following. We may state that Hendrix is currently one of the most adored celebrity kids. Are you curious about him further? You’re in the proper location.

His birthday is November 8, 2007.</p><p>Heaven Hart is Hendrix’s sister and sibling. On March 22, 2005, in the United States, Heaven was born.</p><p>In 2011, Hendrix Hart’s parents got divorced.</p><p>The marriage of Hendrix’s parents, Kevin and Torrei Hart, ended in divorce in 2003 when he began having an affair with Eniko Parrish, his second wife. Torrei and Kevin decided to dissolve their marriage due to his adultery, and in February 2010 they filed for divorce jointly. The divorcing couple stated irreconcilable differences as the reason for their divorce in the court document.</p><p>Hendrix’s father also asked for shared physical custody of their two kids at the same time. November 2011 saw the finalization of their divorce. Although Kevin’s adultery was the primary cause of their divorce, it was long kept a secret.</p><p>In 2016, his father tied the knot for the second time.</p><p>Kevin wed Eniko Parrish after getting divorced from Torrei. After being hitched in 2016, they have been dating. Despite being married in 2016, it appears that the couple was dating for a while beforehand.</p><p>Fans noticed something strange in 2017 when Torrei and Kevin had only recently divorced six years prior, and Kevin’s new wife Parrish posted on Instagram to celebrate their ninth anniversary. In response to a fan pointing out the disparity in a since-deleted comment, Parrish stated that she entered Kevin’s life following his split with Torrei. She went on to say that she didn’t damage anyone’s house.</p><h2><span id=Parents_of_Hendrix_Kevin_and_Torrei>Parents of Hendrix, Kevin, and Torrei</span></h2><p>Following Parrish’s remark, Torrei added her own, telling her to “either respond truthfully or don’t respond at all.” Since then, every remark has been removed. Speaking to TMZ later, Torrei claimed she didn’t have any ill will toward the situation but felt had to address it to prevent her children from believing she was lying.</p><h2><span id=In_2016_Hendrix_Hart_Made_His_First_TV_Appearance>In 2016, Hendrix Hart Made His First TV Appearance</span></h2><p>Hendrix Hart didn’t have to work hard to land his first television role since he was a star child. Despite not having begun a professional career in the entertainment sector, he did have a small part in a television series in 2016.</p><p>In CoryxKenshin, he made a cameo as himself. Despite having limited screen time, several celebrities and reviewers recognized his acting prowess.</p><p>Hendrix attended his father’s second wedding as his best man.</p><p>Hendrix Hart, the 9-year-old son of Kevin Hart, was his stepmother Eniko Parrish’s best man during his wedding. After dating for over seven years, Kevin and Eniko got married on August 13, 2016, close to Santa Barbara, California.</p><p>July 2014 saw Kevin and Eniko become engaged. At the time, Hart announced his engagement to Parrish on Instagram, writing, “She said YEEEEESSSSS. I adore you, #Happy #MyRib #iF-king.”</p><h2><span id=There_Is_A_Stepbrother_Of_Hendrix_Hart>There Is A Stepbrother Of Hendrix Hart</span></h2><p>Kenzo HarYESHart’s stepbrother is Kevin’s son with his wife Parrish.

He seemed to like spending time with his father, though. Along with working out together at the gym, Hendrix and his father often go hiking and cycling.</p><p>Numerous Instagram images by Kevin show him and his kid having a great time riding bikes, going to the beach, taking boat rides, and other activities. More precisely, the father-son team enjoys riding bikes on a regular basis.</p><h2><span id=The_Father_of_Hendrix_Is_A_Multimillionaire>The Father of Hendrix Is A Multimillionaire</span></h2><p>Hendrix Hart hasn’t started a professional. He will be 13 years old in 2020, and he will be occupied with his education. However, Kevin Hart, his father, has had a successful career.</p><p>Throughout nearly two decades of his career, he has amassed an impressive amount of wealth.
