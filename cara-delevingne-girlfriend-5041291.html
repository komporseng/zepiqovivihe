Whether it’s<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> putting a foot down against internet trolls</a> or partaking in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>head-turning social media posts</a>, Cara lives life out loud with no shame. In 2017, she even ranted about her “annoying” friends who don’t understand <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her pansexuality</a>. “Once I spoke about my sexual fluidity, people were like, ‘So you’re gay.’ And I’m like, ‘No, I’m not gay,’” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glamour</a> during her cover interview.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“A lot of the friends I have who are straight have such an old way of thinking,” the 30-year-old former Victoria’s Secret model continued. “It’s, ‘So you’re just gay, right?’ [They] don’t understand it. [If] I’m like, ‘Oh, I really like this guy,’ [they’re like], ‘But you’re gay.’ I’m like, ‘No, you’re so annoying!’ Someone is in a relationship with a girl one minute, or a boy is in a relationship with a boy, I don’t want them to be pigeonholed.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She further opened up about her identity in a 2020 interview with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. “I always will remain, I think, pansexual,” she noted. “However one defines themselves, whether it’s ‘they’ or ‘he’ or ‘she,’ I fall in love with the person — and that’s that. I’m attracted to the person.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Cara has certainly been open about her love life for quite some time — but has she found her person? Read on to learn about Cara Delevingne’s girlfriend and her past romances.</p><h2>Minke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cara-Delevingne-Relationships-embed-21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>As of March 2023, Cara is believed to be dating British singer <strong>Minke</strong>, a.k.a. Leah Mason. The couple was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen smooching</a> in Portofino, Italy in July 2022, but have yet to go <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> official. However,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Cara confirmed she has a girlfriend</a> during a Feb. 2023 appearance on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Kelly Clarkson Show </a>when revealing her<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Valentine’s Day plans</a>. “Sometimes I’ll do a ‘Galentines Day.’ [This year] I’ll probably be spending it at home with my dogs and my girlfriend. Very low-key,” she explained at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Minke is a rising artist with 10,000 followers on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “[Minke] could be an eighties glam rock band, a nineties girl group, or a modern DJ duo,” the London-born singer and songwriter said in her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spotify bio</a>. “I’m as obsessed with Fleetwood Mac as I am with Spice Girls, so the name sums up my admiration for a whole diverse melting pot. I think it’s interesting to hear different sides of an artist. I want to show as much of myself as I can.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>She originally started as a blues artist signed to a record label in Nashville, but she realized that style of music wasn’t true to who she really is. “That’s where Minke came from. I started forming this project in my head while I was doing the blues stuff. It grew from there,” she explained to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Lines of Best Fit</a> in 2019. “I wanted to take those [blues] roots – because that’s in my DNA – and be true to my experiences. That’s why [Minke] has got some blues guitar riffs in there, with modern production and pop stuff in between.”</p><h2>Jaden Smith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cara-Delevingne-Relationships-embed-31.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>Cara and the son of<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Will</strong> and<strong> Jada Pinkett-Smith</strong></a>,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Jaden Smith</strong></a>, who is six years Cara’s junior, sparked dating rumors in 2021 after they were photographed kissing in West Hollywood on Valentine’s Day. Jaden even gifted Cara more than a dozen roses during their romantic outing, which can be seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>. However, their fling was short-lived, as nothing seemingly came from their special rendezvous. Perhaps they were testing the waters to see if they had a real connection after starring in 2020’s &nbsp;Life In A Year&nbsp;together.</p><h2>Ashley Benson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cara-Delevingne-Relationships-embed-11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Fans were heartbroken when Cara and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Pretty Little Liars&nbsp;</a>alum <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ashley Benson</strong></a> broke up in April 2020 after about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two years of dating</a>. Their relationship was full of adorable <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>public PDA moments</a> and sweet interview compliments, such as when Cara revealed in Sept. 2019 that Ashley is the only person with whom she feels comfortable being her genuine self.“I’d never truly let anyone in before, for fear of them leaving,” she admitted to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Porter</a>. “I never really trusted people or felt worthy of it, and I always pushed them away. She’s the first person that has said: ‘You can’t push me away. I’m going to be nice to you, I love you.’ I’m just like, ‘Wait, so all I have to do is just let you be nice to me? Why have I never done that before?’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>A few months earlier, the Paper Towns star thanked Ashley for her support during her speech at the TrevorLIVE Gala in June 2019. “I also have another very special woman in this room to thank and you know who you are. She’s one of the people who help me love myself when I needed it most and I really needed it,” she raved, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>. “She showed me what real love is and how to accept it, which is a lot harder than I thought.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>The pair met while filming Her Smell, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>, and sparked romance rumors when they were seen locking lips at London’s Heathrow Airport in Aug. 2018. They went Instagram official in June 2019 when Cara shared<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a video</a> of themselves making out. Ahead of the above-mentioned TrevorLive Gala, Cara said it felt like the perfect time to make their relationship status public. “Because it is Pride, it’s been 50 years since Stonewall happened and, I don’t know, it’s been just about our one-year anniversary so, why not?” she told E! News.</p><h2>St. Vincent</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cara-Delevingne-Relationships-embed-41.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>Cara and American singer-songwriter <strong>St. Vincent</strong>, a.k.a. Annie Clark, dated for about one year between 2015 to 2016. In 2016, Cara said she was head over heels for her girlfriend. “I’m completely in love … Before, I didn’t know what love was — real love,” she gushed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>British Vogue</a>. “I didn’t understand the depth of it. I always used to think it was you against the world. Now I know the meaning of life is love. Whether that’s for yourself or for the world or your partner.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>She also noted it was nice to have the support of St. Vincent’s parents, as she grew up thinking same-gender relationships were not appropriate. “As a child, I used gay as a bad world, as in, ‘that’s so gay.’ All my friends did,” she noted. “[Her parents] have been so, so supportive. I’m obviously in love, so if people want to say I’m gay, that’s great. But we’re all liquid — we change, we grow.”</p><h2>Jack O’Connell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cara-Delevingne-Relationships-embed-51.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-17>Cara was linked to British actor <strong>Jack O’Connell</strong> in 2014 and had fans in a frenzy after she shared an image of Jack’s alleged neck covered with two hickeys, which she called “love bites” in the Instagram photo she shared. The image is still on her account and can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>. The romance does not appear to have lasted long, but it certainly appeared fun and carefree.</p><h2>Michelle Rodriguez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cara-Delevingne-Relationships-embed-61.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Before Cara got with Jack, she dated<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Fast and Furious</a> actress<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Michelle Rodriguez</strong></a>. The pair were spotted out and about on multiple occasions and Michelle even confirmed their romance in a Feb. 2014 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mirror</a>. “It’s going really well. She’s so cool,” she said. “When we started hanging out I just thought she was awesome, and we have the best time together. She’s hard though. You wouldn’t want to mess with her in a fight.” The pair stayed together for about six months.</p><h2>Jake Bugg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Cara-Delevingne-Relationships-embed-71.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-19>English musician <strong>Jake Bugg</strong> seems to be Caras’s first relationship in the spotlight, although very little is known about it. The pair <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reportedly</a> dated in 2013, but split to focus on their respective careers.</p><h2>Who Else Has Cara Delevigne Been Linked To?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Cara has been rumored to be romantically linked to a few other stars, including<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rita Ora</strong></a>, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>. However, there is minimal proof to back the claims and the relationships were never confirmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KaqZpllJq5psLIp56nnV2ctrO4xaugnqaUYoJxgJBrcGpn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcara-delevingne-girlfriend-5041291.html&text=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20Minke%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcara-delevingne-girlfriend-5041291.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcara-delevingne-girlfriend-5041291.html&title=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20Minke%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcara-delevingne-girlfriend-5041291.html&title=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20Minke%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcara-delevingne-girlfriend-5041291.html&title=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20Minke%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcara-delevingne-girlfriend-5041291.html&description=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20Minke%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-lil-punk-by-trassh-vampire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Meaning Behind The Song: Lil Punk by Trassh Vampire">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./caitlin-clarks-highest-scoring-game.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Caitlin Clark's Highest Scoring Game">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
