Am I a fan of bananas? YES. So, am I now a monkey? NO.”</p><h3>Erin is Duncan’s support system</h3><p>Erin Trussell, Duncan’s Trussell wife, has always stood by him, especially during his most difficult times. ‘The Midnight Gospel’s’ climax.</p><p>He described how he and Erin, who were both pregnant at the time, listened to his mother’s moving message using a tape of her voice.</p><p>“We were in a bed in this hotel room, and I wanted her to meet my mum,” Duncan recalled the incident.We both started crying as I replayed that dialogue.</p><p>Duncan has always had Erin at his side, offering support and love when things go tough.</p><h3>Erin’s Appearance on DTFH</h3><p>Erin has made a major appearance on Duncan’s podcast, The Duncan Trussell Family Hour (DTFH), despite the fact that she generally avoids the media.</p><p>Erin is presented in the episode in a casual and amusing way as “cult-mommy and Duncan’s intimate lover.”</p><p>Her involvement gave the programme a vibrant and exciting dynamic while showing the couple’s common sense of humour.</p><h3>A closer look at Duncan wife</h3><p>A closer look at Duncan’s wife Erin Trussell, who prefers to keep her personal details out of the media, leads a secluded existence.</p><p>She was born in Los Angeles, California, to American parents.
