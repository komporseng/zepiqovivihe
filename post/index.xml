そのチケットは爆発的な倍率で即完売し、
１０年ぶりに帰るコースト公演が間近に迫ってます。
細美武士さんの言動に注目が集まっていますが、
エルレが復活してからは、チケット絡みで悲しい話題が増えました。
ブログの更新はすっかりとストップしてますが、
エレルでの久々のライブに向けて、
音合わせやセットの調整などに忙しいそうなので、
そこは仕方ないですね・・・。
できれば音楽のことだけに集中して欲しいですが、
ファン的にはあのチケットの状況をなんとかして欲しいと、
細美武士さんのこれからの言動に注目が集まっています。
ブログも平和な話題が多いのですが、
エルレの公演が決まってからは、
ちょっとギスギスした印象になってのが悲しいです。
細美武士のﾌﾞﾛｸﾞやﾗｼﾞｵが素敵！
細美さんがブログに書く内容というのは、
音楽に纏わる話題も多いですが、
自分の旅行記なども書いたりするのです。
最近のアーティストのネットで発信することといえば、
他アーティストとの交流や、かっこいい写真などに溢れますが、
細美さんのブログはちょっと違います。
引用：細身ブログ
歳食っておじさんになったせいもあると思いますが、
写真の撮り方や文章がジャーナリスト寄りな感じです。。笑
さらには、たまに撮る自撮りも無機質で質素な感じ。これが逆にかっこよかったりするのですが。。
一番グッとくるのは、エルレの活動が休止した日に書くブログです。
毎年のように休止してどれだけの年月が経ったのか、自分なりに考えたブログを投稿するのです。世の中のほとんどのエルレファンが、エルレの休止を引きずっていましたが、細美さんも同じように考え続けていたのです。
ついに活動を再開させたということで、
そのドラマの繋がりが、より深く思えるのです。
ラジオに関してはまた違った一面を見せますが、
ライブのMCと、ブログと、ラジオと、
その違った顔１つ１つが良いバランスなのです。
全部、細美さんらしいのですが、
全てが同じように思えない、
でも一貫性がある。
これはすごいことです。素敵です。
ｴﾙﾚﾁｹｯﾄの転売と同行者募集者の下心 エルレの先行販売に応募した人の数は凄まじく、
二次まで落選の報告で溢れました。
一般が始まる前からチケットが４０万以上の値段で売られたり、
学生ファンのためにギリギリの価格で販売してるメンバーの気持ちは踏みにじられてます。
一般販売が始まる前から、
スマチケ限定に、分配はできない仕組みにし、
できるだけ転売に対して対策を打ってきました。
チケットが安いのに、
身分証明を確認するスタッフを配置するなど、
利益どころの話ではありません。
それでも行動してくれたエルレはやはりすごいです！
しかし、今度は別の問題も出ています。
それは「同行者募集」です。
当選した当人がいないと入場できない仕組みなので、
同行者を募集するという話を持ちかける方が多いのですが、
その同行者の条件が、かなり悪質なのです。
まず、若い女性でなければいけなかったり、
物販や交通費、ホテル代を負担させたり、
チケット代に数万を要求したり、やりたい放題です。
ツイッターでは、同行者が見つかったものの、
同じホテルに泊まらせてくれないかと言われたり、
朝まで一緒にいることをお願いされ、断った瞬間に、
「もっと条件の良い方が見つかりました」と破談になった報告もあります。
ホテルに行っていいって言われてるってことは、
きっとその女性はすでにホテルを予約済みだったのでしょう、
それが破談になったってかなり痛いですね。
お金の次は下心でエルレファンを悩ます層が登場したことで、
この問題は永久的に続きそうだなと・・・。
